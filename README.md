My name is Lisa Phan, and I'm a rising junior at Amherst College studying Computer Science and Psychology, passionate about understanding how people think and make decisionsâ€”and how technology and businesses can better serve them. 

Over the past year, I've been working to develop a well-rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of human experienceâ€”exploring everything from machine learning and consumer-centered app design to mental health interventions. I'm currently looking to build my expertise in human-centered AI and machine learning by developing agents, chatbots, and virtual therapists/assistants through projects or internships, where I can also learn from peers and industry professionals. Would love to collaborate with anyone sharing similar interests!

ðŸ”­ Tech Stack:
- Programming Languages: Java, Python, SQL
- Data Science: Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn
- UI/UX and Design: Figma, Canva, Procreate, Spline
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub
- Other: Microsoft Office Suite

ðŸŒ± Personal Projects: 
- God's Judgment:
  Developed a game, featuring self-drawn pixel art and dynamic world management (e.g., plague/immigration) with ratings to prime accountability; engineered sprite animation, optimal pathfinding (BFS) and collision detection; 3k lines of code
  + Learning: movement implementation, BFS and collision, project management
  
- Home with You (Meta-Space 3D Apartment):
  Developed brief for a meta-space platform to combat feeling of absence in long-distance relationships by addressing pain points like lack of real-time awareness of loved onesâ€™ lives and non-verbal cues with status and emotion displays
  Conducted user research and competitive analysis, defining core features, including customizable avatars, relationshipbuilding tasks, and integrated video calls, watch parties, and multiplayer games to simulate co-presence
  + Learning: UI/UX, customer research

- ML Foundations Project: Predicting Happiness based on Country's Indicators
  Built and optimized a machine learning model to predict the country's happiness level based on the country's social, economical, and political indicators, such as GDP, Health Expectancy, etc.
  + Learning: building a prediction system, scikit-learn, model evaluation and optimization

ðŸ‘¯ Extracurriculars/Interests:
- I'm the president of Women in Computer Science Club at Amherst College. My goal is to create a supportive community for collaboration and problem-solving for underrepresented communities in tech
- I love exploring new music, and sometimes write songs in my free time
- On the weekends, I like to volunteer at a local kitchen where I can help make delicious food to share with the members of the community!
